# dakit_cli

A pure-Dart command-line client for [DAKit](https://github.com/redtidev1918/dakit):
sign in with the official OAuth API and download single deviations, artist
galleries, folders, favourites, or search results, plus account and
connectivity diagnostics. Downloads use the official API; the only web call is
resolving numeric page ids to UUIDs through the website's public
`_puppy/dadeviation/init` endpoint, exactly as DAViewer does.

## Usage

Download a standalone binary from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/redtidev1918/dakit/releases?q=dakit_cli).
Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64, and macOS Intel/Apple Silicon archives are built
for CLI releases, with checksums. Dart and Flutter are not required at runtime.

The macOS archives are unsigned previews without Apple Developer ID signing or
notarization.

From a source checkout, the root launcher scripts wrap the same entry point:

```shell
./dakit --help
./devart-dl artist USERNAME
```

Or run the Dart entry point directly:

```shell
dart run packages/dakit_cli/bin/dakit.dart login --client-id YOUR_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID
dart run packages/dakit_cli/bin/dakit.dart url https://fav.me/df3y58p --dest downloads
dart run packages/dakit_cli/bin/dakit.dart url https://www.deviantart.com/loish/gallery --limit 50
```

`devart-dl` is a compatibility alias of the same CLI, kept for long-time
`devart-dl` users; the standalone release binary is `dakit`.

`url` accepts any DeviantArt link — artwork/journal pages, fav.me short links,
user galleries, gallery/favourites folders, tag pages, and search URLs — and
auto-detects the download target (numeric web ids resolve to UUIDs
automatically). Batch commands add `--archive FILE` (skip already-downloaded
ids), `--filename TEMPLATE` (`{id}` `{title}` `{username}` `{published}`
`{filename}` `{ext}`), and `--write-info-json` (a metadata `.json` sidecar per
artwork).

Whitelist `http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback` on a Public OAuth application.
`login` opens the system browser and receives that local callback. Use
`--manual --no-open` only for headless systems. Credentials refresh
automatically and are stored under `~/.config/dakit/` (Windows:
`%APPDATA%/dakit/`). Downloads stream to a `.part` file and preserve existing
destinations unless `--overwrite` is passed. Every network command accepts
`--verbose` / `-v` for sanitized diagnostics.

### Mature (age-restricted) multi-image works

The official OAuth API **cannot** see mature multi-image deviations —
`deviation/{uuid}` returns 404 for them and never returns their additional
pages. The website's own `_puppy/dadeviation/init` endpoint, called with a
logged-in **web cookie**, does return every page (main + attachments).

Provide that cookie to the `url` command and mature multi-image works download
in full:

```bash
# inline (a "name=value; name2=value2" Cookie header)
dakit url https://www.deviantart.com/<artist>/art/<slug>-<id> \
  --cookies 'auth=…; auth_secure=…; userinfo=…'

# or read from a file
dakit url <url> --cookies @~/da-cookies.txt

# or via environment
DAKIT_COOKIES='auth=…; auth_secure=…' dakit url <url>
```

Get the cookie by logging into deviantart.com in your browser and copying the
`auth` / `auth_secure` / `userinfo` cookies (DevTools → Application → Cookies).
The cookie is a secret: it is never logged (diagnostics redact `cookie` /
`set-cookie`, and the session's `toString` exposes only `present` /
`authenticated` flags). Without a cookie, non-mature works still download via
the OAuth API; a mature multi-image failure prints a hint to pass `--cookies`.
