### Code Refactoring

* rename the SDK to DAKit ([a9f0837](https://github.com/redtidev1918/dakit/commit/a9f0837f22ad1128c4587998ba0c0d11103462f0))

## 0.1.13

- Update DAKit API and Core dependencies to the released 0.2.x series.

## 0.1.12

### Docs

- Publish pub.dev topics (`deviantart`, `deviantart-api`, `oauth`, `pkce`,
  `downloader`, …) so the package is discoverable in pub.dev search.

## 0.1.11


### Docs

- Modernized the package README: pub.dev badges, install snippet, and
  documentation links.

## 0.1.10

### Fixed

- `clientSecureStorage` disables Android `resetOnError`: the plugin default
  deletes a stored value on any decryption failure, which silently wiped the
  OAuth token after a restart and forced a re-login. The token now survives a
  transient Keystore/decrypt error and the next launch retries the read.

## 0.1.9

### Fixed

- `BackgroundTransferManager.moveToSharedStorage` on Android keeps the
  app-readable private copy while still exposing the shared copy, so in-app
  previews keep working under scoped storage (a file moved into public
  Downloads via MediaStore is not readable back by the app).

## 0.1.8

### Fixed

- `BackgroundTransferManager.remove` now deletes unique known file paths before
  removing the persisted record. File/path failures throw retryable typed
  storage errors and retain metadata, preventing silent orphan files.

## 0.1.7

### Added

- `clientSecureStorage(serviceName:)` — builds a Keychain-backed
  `FlutterSecureStorage` whose macOS keychain item is labelled with a
  user-facing product name (instead of the plugin default
  `flutter_secure_storage_service`), so macOS's authorization prompt no longer
  reads like the host is reaching for arbitrary secrets. Keeps
  `usesDataProtectionKeychain: false` so unsigned builds still work.

## 0.1.6

### Changed

- `BackgroundTransferManager.remove` now also deletes the downloaded file (both the moved shared-storage copy and the app-private original), not just the persisted record.

## 0.1.5

### Added

- `MasonryGridView` / `SliverMasonryGrid` — a lazy, balanced masonry (waterfall) layout for variable-height grid content (e.g. image galleries).

## 0.1.4

### Added

- `BackgroundTransferManager.remove` added finished-transfer cleanup. Its
  original record-only behavior was superseded by destructive removal in
  0.1.6 and fail-closed removal in 0.1.8.

## 0.1.3

### Fixed

- Persist moved shared-storage paths (`moveToSharedStorage`) so the download
  list reports the correct location after an app restart instead of a stale
  private path.

## 0.1.2

### Added

- `BackgroundTransferManager.moveToSharedStorage` moves a completed download
  into a system shared-storage location (e.g. the public Downloads folder) and
  re-emits the snapshot with the updated path.

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

- `DAKitOAuthClient.logout` no longer aborts when clearing the pending PKCE
  transaction fails (e.g. macOS keychain access denied for an unsigned host).
  Logout now always clears the token store, so a subsequent sign-in can request
  fresh scopes.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- `DAKitOAuthClient` composition root for system-browser login, cold-start
  callback recovery, and token lifecycle.
- Secure token and pending authorization stores backed by
  `flutter_secure_storage`.
- `BackgroundTransferManager` with queued, running, paused, completed, failed,
  and cancelled transfer state tracking.
- App links and system URI launcher adapters.
