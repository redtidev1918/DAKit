DAKit is a modular DeviantArt client SDK for Dart and Flutter. It provides
authentication, the official HTTP API, domain models, diagnostics, and
background transfers for Android, macOS, and Windows apps. You can use it to
build a full third-party client or as a single building block.

This project is maintained independently by the community and is not affiliated
with or endorsed by DeviantArt. "DeviantArt" is used only to name the service
the SDK connects to.

> **Reference app**: [DAViewer](https://github.com/redtidev1918/DAViewer) is a
> complete third-party DeviantArt client built on DAKit — born because
> DeviantArt abandoned its official app — and is the best example of DAKit in
> real use.

## What it can do

- Sign in with Authorization Code + PKCE through the system browser;
- Persist the OAuth session securely and resume callbacks after a restart;
- Read the current account, user profiles and relationships, artwork details and
  text, home/search, daily deviations, and the watched feed;
- Browse tags, tag autocomplete, topic navigation, and gallery/favourites folder
  listings and contents;
- Read the "More Like This" preview; one malformed or deleted entry does not
  discard valid siblings;
- Read/post artwork comments, favourite/unfavourite artworks, watch/unwatch
  users;
- Read notifications, feedback, and mentions, and expand or delete message
  stacks;
- Resolve the original file from its dedicated endpoint, never passing a
  thumbnail off as the original;
- Queue, resume, pause, cancel, and safely delete background transfers on
  Flutter while retaining records when file removal fails;
- Configure API and media proxies separately, and diagnose DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTP,
  OAuth, parsing, and storage failures;
- Swap the network, sign-in, storage, or transfer layers behind stable domain
  interfaces.

Not yet implemented: submission/editing of artworks, Notes (private messages),
and a local database. Private website endpoints or page scraping are not part of
the stable API.

## Before you start

Before running any sign-in, download, or diagnostics flow:

- You need a DeviantArt developer application. Client-style programs (the sample
  client, CLI, and Android/macOS/Windows apps) must choose **Public**; choose
  **Confidential** only when credentials are kept safely on a server.
- A Public app only needs `client_id`; do not use or store `client_secret`.
  DAKit's client sign-in flow never accepts a secret.
- The callback URI must be added verbatim to the app's OAuth2 Redirect URI
  Whitelist:
  - Flutter sample client / desktop: `dakit://oauth/callback`
  - CLI: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback`
- Sign-in needs a `client_id`; downloads also need an artwork UUID (not the
  slug/numeric id in a web URL).

## Networking / egress requirements (important)

DeviantArt blocks datacenter egress IPs on the website and parts of the API (the WAF allowlists
by egress range):

- **Blocked in practice**: Cloudflare Workers (website 403, official API data plane 500),
  Fly.io (website 403), and most cloud hosts; some hosting ranges also get 400/404 on media
  variants (`/v1/fit|fill`).
- **Known-good egress**: residential networks work; on a VPS, route through a proxy such as
  clash/mihomo to an allowed egress.
- If the website path (`_puppy/dadeviation/init` resolution, artwork pages) returns 403/400 and
  changing UA or adding a Referer does not help, change the network egress first.
- **Mature content**: anonymous requests only get blurred previews (`blur_*` variants);
  unblurred originals require sign-in (OAuth or Cookie). Originals go through the official
  `deviation/download/{uuid}` endpoint and are limited by the **free account daily download
  quota**; over the limit returns `Free download limit reached` — fall back to the display
  image or subscribe to Core.

## Package layout

| Package | Purpose | Flutter dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dakit_core` | Models, errors, repository contracts, pagination, diagnostics, transfer contracts | none |
| `dakit_api` | OAuth PKCE, network config, connectivity checks, official API implementation | none |
| `dakit_web` | Private web protocol adapters (Wix, `_puppy/init`, search/RFY/collections/gallery/profile/More Like This) | none |
| `dakit_flutter` | System browser, deep links, secure storage, background transfers | yes |
| `dakit_cli` | Pure-Dart CLI for sign-in, downloads, and diagnostics | none |
| `example_client` | Android/macOS/Windows integration and diagnostics client | app |

Dependency direction is fixed: `dakit_flutter → dakit_api → dakit_core`; `dakit_cli` may additionally use `dakit_web → dakit_core`.
Business apps depend only on the layer they need; use `dakit_flutter` for full
Flutter integration.

## Install

The packages are published to pub.dev. A full Flutter integration only needs
`dakit_flutter`, which transitively resolves `dakit_api` and `dakit_core`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dakit_flutter: ^1.0.0
```

If you only need pure-Dart capabilities, declare them individually:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dakit_core: ^1.1.0
  dakit_api: ^1.1.0
```

For optional private-website adapters, add:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dakit_web: ^0.2.1
```

Then read [Getting started](docs/en/GETTING_STARTED.md). To run the built-in
sign-in flow on mobile or desktop, register a **Public** OAuth app and configure
the exact callback `dakit://oauth/callback`.

## Command-line client

No Dart or Flutter installation is required. Download the archive matching your
OS and CPU from
[DAKit CLI Releases](https://github.com/redtidev1918/DAKit/releases?q=dakit_cli):
Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64, or macOS Intel/Apple Silicon. macOS binaries are
explicitly marked **unsigned previews**: they have no Apple Developer ID
signature or notarization, so Gatekeeper can block the first launch. Every
release includes `SHA256SUMS`.

```text
dakit --help
dakit status --proxy 127.0.0.1:7892
dakit login --client-id YOUR_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID
dakit whoami
dakit url https://www.deviantart.com/loish/art/underwater-913624585 --dest downloads
dakit url https://fav.me/df3y58p --dest downloads
dakit url https://www.deviantart.com/loish/gallery --limit 50 --archive done.txt
dakit artist USERNAME --limit 24 --delay 0
dakit gallery USERNAME [GALLERY_ID]
dakit fav USERNAME [FOLDER_ID]
dakit search "digital art" --limit 24
dakit logout
```

`url` accepts any DeviantArt link and auto-detects the target: artwork/journal
pages, fav.me short links, user galleries, gallery/favourites folders, tag
pages, and search URLs all route to the matching downloader (numeric web ids
are resolved to UUIDs automatically). Batch downloads also support
`--archive FILE` (skip already-downloaded ids), `--filename TEMPLATE`
(`{id}` `{title}` `{username}` `{published}` `{filename}` `{ext}`), and
`--write-info-json` (a metadata `.json` sidecar next to each artwork).

Before login, register a **Public** DeviantArt OAuth app and whitelist
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback` exactly. `login` opens the system browser and
receives the callback locally; the DeviantArt password never enters the CLI.
For a remote or headless system, also whitelist `dakit://oauth/callback` and use
`--manual --no-open`.

Credentials live under `~/.config/dakit/` (Windows: `%APPDATA%/dakit/`) and
refresh automatically. `logout` revokes the remote token; `logout --local`
only removes local credentials. Downloads stream through a temporary file and
preserve an existing destination unless `--overwrite` is explicit.

Configure a proxy with `--proxy HOST:PORT`, `--proxy http://HOST:PORT`,
`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, or an HTTP-form `all_proxy`. `--verbose` / `-v`
writes redacted diagnostics to `stderr`. The CLI only supports HTTP proxies and
does not silently treat SOCKS5 as HTTP.

Downloads and sign-in prefer the official OAuth API. Numeric page ids are
resolved through the website's public `_puppy/dadeviation/init` endpoint (it
reads the homepage CSRF token). The CLI supports HTTP proxies only (it does not
silently treat SOCKS5 as HTTP), `--verbose` / `-v` writes redacted diagnostics
to `stderr`, and it never passes a preview off as the original.

### Mature (age-restricted) multi-image works

The official OAuth API **cannot** see mature multi-image deviations:
`deviation/{uuid}` returns 404 for them and never returns their additional
pages. The website's own `_puppy/dadeviation/init` endpoint, called with a
logged-in **web cookie**, does return every page (main file plus attachments).
Pass that cookie to `url` and mature multi-image works download in full:

```bash
dakit url <work-url> --cookies 'auth=…; auth_secure=…; userinfo=…'
dakit url <work-url> --cookies @~/da-cookies.txt          # read from a file
DAKIT_COOKIES='auth=…; auth_secure=…' dakit url <work-url>  # env var
```

Copy the `auth` / `auth_secure` / `userinfo` cookies from a logged-in browser
(DevTools → Application → Cookies). The cookie is a secret: it is never logged
(diagnostics redact `cookie`/`set-cookie`, and the session's `toString` shows
only `present`/`authenticated` flags). Without a cookie, non-mature works still
download via OAuth; a mature multi-image failure prints a hint to pass
`--cookies`. See `packages/dakit_cli/README.md`.


## Minimal example

```dart
final diagnostics = MyDiagnosticSink();
final network = NetworkProfile.environment();
final oauth = DAKitOAuthClient(
  config: OAuthConfig(
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: Uri.parse('dakit://oauth/callback'),
  ),
  networkProfile: network,
  diagnostics: diagnostics,
);

final restored = await oauth.resumePending();
final tokens = restored ?? await oauth.authorize();

final transport = OfficialApiClient(
  session: oauth.session,
  networkProfile: network,
  diagnostics: diagnostics,
);
final account = await OfficialAccountRepository(transport).currentUser();
```

`authorize()` should be triggered by a user action. Create the client early at
startup and call `resumePending()` to receive cold-start deep links.

**Development & maintenance** (for contributors and maintainers):

- [Architecture](docs/en/ARCHITECTURE.md): boundaries, extension points,
  compatibility policy;
- [Development](docs/en/DEVELOPMENT.md): toolchain, tests, three-platform builds,
  CI, releases;
- [Releasing](docs/en/RELEASING.md): package versioning and pub.dev publishing;
- [Live testing](docs/en/LIVE_TESTING.md): a full media matrix requiring user
  authorization;
- [Status](docs/en/STATUS.md): verified results and follow-up work.

## Development

The project pins Flutter 3.47.1 / Dart 3.13.1. Run the full quality gate:

```shell
./tool/verify.sh
```

Ordinary CI has no OAuth credentials. Unit tests, Android APK, macOS app, and
Windows/MSIX builds are verified on GitHub Actions; the live-account media
matrix still needs a valid Public OAuth app and test material.

## Design principles

- Never store `client_secret` on the client, and never bypass anti-bot checks;
- Do not use an embedded WebView in place of system-browser sign-in;
- Never disable TLS verification, and never log tokens, authorization codes,
  cookies, or PKCE verifiers;
- Do not expose upstream DTOs, plugin types, or a specific state-management
  framework as public domain API;
- Do not promise automatic adaptation to arbitrary website changes; compatibility
  is maintained by centralized adapters and contract tests.
